# 🐍 Pyrus - Python Desktop Prank (Fake Virus)

**Pyrus** is a harmless desktop prank script written in Python. It simulates a series of fake error screens using full-screen images and plays a sound, creating the illusion of a system crash (BSOD-style).



## 🧩 Features

- Fullscreen fake "crash" interface
- Plays a looping sound
- Responds to mouse click
- Locks the user interface (visually only)
- Uses screenshots and fake error screens

## 🚀 How it Works

1. Takes a screenshot of the current desktop
2. Displays a full-screen `tkinter` window with fake error images
3. Plays a looping `.wav` file in the background
4. Prevents normal window closing (optionally)
